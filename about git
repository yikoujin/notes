############GIT BRANCH MERGE
Git branch merge #which means putting the branches of git together!
💖merge branches:
✨we have the emergency fix ready#we are ready for the emergency fix,and so merge the master#main branch and emergency-fix(紧急修复) branches

💕change to the master branch:
  [user@localhost]$
git checkout master
Swiched to branch 'master'
  
💕merge the current branch(master) with emergency-fix branch:
  [user@localhost]$
   git merge emergency-fix
   Updating 09f4acd..dfa79db
   Fast-forward
    index.html| 2+-
    1 file changed,1 insertion(+),1 deletion(-)
  
😂Since the emergency-fix branch came directly from master,and no other changes had been made to master while we were working,Git sees this as a continuation of master.So it can
"Fast-forward",just pointing both master and emergency-fix to the same commit.

😍As master and emergency-fix are essentially the same now,we can delete emergency-fix,as it is no longer needed:
[user@localhost]$ 
git branch -d emergency-fix
Deleted branch emergency-fix (was dfa79db)  

Merge Conflict
move over to hello-world-images and keep working.#转到hello-world-images并继续工作
Add another image file(img_hello_git.jpg)
change index.html
[user@localhost]$
git checkout hello-world-images
Swiched to branch'hello-world-images'

😊example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World!"</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bluestyle.css">
</head>
</body>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<div><img src ="img_hello_world.jpg" alt="Hello world from space" stype="width:100%;max-width:960px"></div>
<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
<p>Aa new line in out file!</p>
<div><img src="img_hello_git.jpg" alt="Hello Git"  style="width:100%;max-width:960px"></div>
</body>
</html>

Now we are done with our work here and can stage and commit for this branch:(为这个分支暂存和提交)
💖git add --all
  git commit -m "added new image"
[hello-world-images 1f1584e] added new image
2 files changed, 1 insertion(+)
creat mode 100644 img_hello_git.jpg

we see that index.html has been changed in both branches.
Now we are ready to merge hello-world-images into master.
what will happen to the changes we recently made in master?

###########GIT BRANCH
working eith git branches 
in Git,a branch（分支） is a new/seperate version(新的版本或者分开的版本) of the main repository（主仓库）
we have a large project,we need to update thhe design on it.
with git:
✔with a new branch called new-design.edit the code directly without impacting the main branch
✔EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
Creat a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch
You go back to the new-design branch,and finish the work there
Merge the new-design branch with main(getting alerted to the small error fix that you were missing)


Branches allow you to work on a different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.
When the work is complete,a branch can be merged with the main project.
you can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!


New Git Branch:
Let add some new feachers to out index.html page.(想修改index.html文件中的特点，但是不想破坏主文件)
we are working in a local repository ,and we do not want to disturb or possibly wreck the main project.
So we creat a new branch.

git branch hello-world-images    (新建git分支    hello-world-images)

来确认一下：
git branch
  hello-world-images
  *master
  * means that we are currently on the hello-world-images  branch.
  
  checkout是用来检查一个分支的命令。
  （将我们从当前的分支移动到命令末尾指定的分支）
git checkout hello-world-images
Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'

git status 
O branch hello-world-images
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add ..." to update what will be commited)
(use "git restore ..." to discard changes in working directory)
modified:index.html
 Untracked files:
 (use 'git add...' to include in what will be commited)
 img_hello_world.jpg


no changes added  to commit(use "git add" and /or "git commit -a")

go through what happens here:
 There are changes to our index.html,but the file is not staged for commit
 img_hello_world.jpg is not tracked
 
add files to Staging Environment for this branch:
 
 
git  add --all   git 暂存所有的改变.
使用 --all 而不是单个文件名将暂存所有更改的（新的、修改的和删除的）文件

检查当前分支的状态：
git status
On branch hello-world-images
Changes to be committed:
(use "git restore --staged..."to unstage)
new file:img_hello_world.jpg
modified:index.html

we are happy with our changes changes.So we will commit them to the branch.


.............to be continued.
